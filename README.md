## Running local server ##

### Installing Ruby ###

- Download and install [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv).
- Download and install [Ruby-Build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build).
- Install the appropriate Ruby version by running `rbenv install [version]` where `version` is the one located in [.ruby-version](.ruby-version)

### Installing Rails gems ###

- Clone the repository.
- Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).
- Install all the gems included in the project.

 ```bash
  > git clone https://github.com/Wolox/rails-bootstrap.git
  > gem install bundler
  > rbenv rehash
  > bundle
 ```

### Application Setup ###

Run `./script/bootstrap app_name` where `app_name` is your application name.

Your app is ready. Happy coding!

## Running with Docker ##

Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and then run:

  ```bash
    > git clone https://github.com/Wolox/internal.git
    > docker-compose up
  ```

OSX: Get the IP running `boot2docker ip` in and enter port `3000` in the browser.

When the servers starts, run the following command in a different console:

  ```bash
    > docker-compose run web rake db:create db:seed
  ```

To stop the server run the following command in a different console:

  ```bash
    > docker-compose stop
  ```
To see the running process, run the following command in a different console:

  ```bash
    > docker-compose ps
  ```

New dependencies should be added to [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and then run:

  ```bash
    > docker-compose build
  ```
